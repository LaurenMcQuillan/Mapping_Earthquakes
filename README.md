# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map that displays earthquake data from the past 7 days.  The map includes three map styles: Streets, Satellite, and Dark. It also includes three layers that can be toggled on and off to display all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plate lines.
